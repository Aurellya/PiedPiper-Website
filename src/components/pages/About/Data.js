    "Pied Piper is a multi-platform technology based on a proprietary universal compression algorithm that has consistently fielded high Weisman Scores that are not merely competitive, but approach the theoritical limit of losless compression. Only Pied Piper has the necessary tools to build the internet of the future, today.",
    "In it's original incarnation, Pied Piper was a songwriter-oriented app that made it easier for song writers to determine if their work infringed on other's copyright. And frankly, we still think that wasn't a terrible idea, and we were kind of looking forward to doing it, because who doesn't like music, right?",
    "However, based on user feedback that was suboptimal and on occasion downright mean, we are now curently pivoting to as a SaaS model to create a new 'compression cloud' solution that covers a far wider user base. This new strategy bring us a clearer path to monetization and helps us even avoid the crappy licansing models for Lempel-Ziv-Welch in .gif files (among others). Because Lord knows, there aren't enough compressed .gif files in the world that have cats making faces with rap lyrics underneath them.",
